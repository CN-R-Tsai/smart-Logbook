Especially in the semiconductor industry, where there are hundreds of equipment in use, having a clear and always accessible overview is extremely useful.

## What is equipment maintenance log?

Having logs that record maintenance activities are important. The proper tracking of machinery maintenance logs helps team prioritize preventive maintenance and understand which tasks need to be performed to ensure the equipment is in good condition.
