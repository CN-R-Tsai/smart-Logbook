 Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to visit my Github repo. 

## Introduction
Keeping track of equipment and assets can be difficult and time-consuming. That being said, it is important and a key factor for every organization. Especially in the semiconductor industry, where there are hundreds of equipment in use, having a clear and always accessible overview is extremely useful. 

## What is Equipment maintenance log?
An equipment maintenance log is a document where maintenance activities performed on an asset are recorded for easy reference. 
Having logs that record maintenance activities are important. The proper tracking of machinery maintenance logs helps team prioritize preventive maintenance and understand which tasks need to be performed to ensure the equipment is in good condition.


## Improving the existing flow
The flow of recording equipment maintenance log management was manual process. Internal stakeholders used Excel spreadsheets to manage the equipment maintenance log daily. Using Excel spreadsheets causes inefficient manual processes, high operational costs, greater risk of errors.  

## Web application development
Web apps make it easy for easily tracking and managing repairs. It enables communication for unlimited users and provides a real-time view of equipment health, location and status.
